one:
  email: john_doe@hotmail.com
  first_name: John
  last_name: Doe
  encrypted_password: <%= BCrypt::Password.create("123456") %>

# two:
#   email: "user_two@example.com"
#   password: "password" # Ensure this matches your authentication setup
#   password_confirmation: "password"
#   full_name: "User Two"
